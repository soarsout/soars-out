              delay their studies and become behind in classes. A solution that will help poeple study without becoming distracted is to either place their phone 
              in a different room where it is nowhere to be seen or you could either study in a quiet area such as the library, that way there are no distractions 
              and if family is one of the distractions then it is recommended to study at a library where there is silence and no distractions, allowing you to 
              focus and study everything you need to catch up on or any work.</p>

          <h1>Studying when you're tired</h1>
          <p>Studing without having enough sleep is inefficient, you will not be able to focus as much and remember notes while studying. Therefore, it is important
             that you ensure that you have had enough sleep and rest, that way when you have enough energy you will be able to stay productive when studying. 
             Another important thing to look out for is when you have had enough sleep and you are very energized then you can try studying a bit during that time.</p>

          <h1>Multitasking</h1>
          <p>Multitasking is a common thing for many people, they tend to focus on more than one subject during the limited amount of time they have. 
            A solution for this is to divide your work and pay attention to the subject that you find more difficult and then shift your attention 
            to other subjects once you have finished and it is also recommended to leave the subject you find the least difficult for last, almost like a treat.</p>

          <h1>Not asking for help when needed</h1>
          <p>Many people are afraid to ask help from teachers or peers when in need of assistance. Without asking for assistance this will not help 
            when it comes to studying due to the lack of knowledge you have. It is important that you correct this bad habit as it wont only help 
            improve your grades but will also allow you to overcome that fear and improve your skills. By starting off small you can ask for help from your friends 
            and classmates and then once you feel more confident in asking, you can start asking for help from your teachers or tutors. Remember it is a teachers job 
            to help you.</p>

          <h1>Having notes everywhere</h1>
          <p>This is a main bad habit that people have, having notes placed everywhere will not be helpful as it will be difficult for you to find notes 
            for a certain subject as it is piled up with every other subject notes. Additionally, this will cause some people to panick as they may have 
            only one copy and have not memorised what was on it or some may have to rewrite their notes which causes them to delay their studies. Therefore,
            it is important to prioritise having a neat work space where it is easy for you to find notes for a specific subject.</p>
