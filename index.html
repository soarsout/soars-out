         <h2> Mission and Purpose:</h2>

       a safe, culturally grounded space where rangatahi can explore their potential and build real-world skills. Our 
       kaupapa is about ensuring young people feel seen, heard, and supported as they navigate education, work, money,
       wellbeing, and leadership.

     <h2> Our Approach:</h2>
    We prioritise lived experience, recognising that rangatahi know what rangatahi need. 
    Rooted in South Auckland values - Whanaungatanga, Manaakitanga, and Tino Rangatiratanga.
    Blending online and in-person learning, ensuring accessibility for busy students, workers, and 
    young parents.
    Providing content that is honest, culturally aware, and actually relevant to the realities of young people today.

         <h2>Why Soars Out Matters:</h2>
    Many young people feel unprepared for adulthood - we change that. We fill the gap between school
    and the real world with skills you don't get taught in class: financial literacy, workforce, and university management.
    We open pathways to opportunities through connections, mentoring, and community networks.
    We help build confident, capable, and future-ready rangatahi who can take up space and truly take their place.

    A future where every young person has the tools, support, and belief in themselves to thrive, lead, and SOAR OUT into their
    full potential.
